# Storybook API reference

GreyVest's documentation is written using Storybook 5.2's [Docs addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/docspage.md) with stories in [CSF format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df).

CSF stories declare a configuration object as their default export. The API looks like this:

```js
export default {
  title,
  component,
  decorators,
  parameters: {
    componentSubtitle,
    info,
    props
  },
}
```

### A note on customizations

Storybook docs are supposed to automatically parse PropTypes and JSDocs into data for the description and props table, but this is not ideal for us for two reasons:

1. Our widespread use of HOCs such as mobx-react's `observer` means that Storybook has trouble parsing metadata for a lot of our components (this will likely be ironed out as Storybook Docs matures, but we'd rather not wait for that to happen)
2. We haven't historically used PropTypes and would have to add the data in some format to each of our components or stories anyway - and for documentation only, using PropTypes is less flexible than manually specifying the arguments to PropTable

As a result, our storybook configuration is customized to pass the values from the `props` and `info` properties in `parameters` directly into Storybook's PropsTable and Description components, respectively.


## Subtitle

`componentSubtitle` is a built-in Storybook property for the subtitle of a DocsPage. It supports JSX expressions.

### Example

```jsx
{
  componentSubtitle: <>Button with <tt>large</tt> and <tt>compact</tt> variants</>
}
```


## Description

You can supply a description for the story with the `info` property. It takes only strings, but supports markdown formatting.

### Example

```js
{
  info:
"
GreyVest's `Button` features **five** component-level styling variants: `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Tertiary`, `Danger`, and `Ghost`. The variants are subcomponents of Button.
"
}
```


## Props

The `props` property accepts an object with two keys, `rows` and `sections`. Only one of these is used; if `sections` has a value, it overrides `rows`.

| Property | Value  |
| --- | --- |
| `rows` | an array of prop definitions |
| `sections` | an object where each key is a section heading, and each value is an array of prop definitions |

A prop definition has the following shape (see Storybook's [PropDef](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/lib/components/src/blocks/PropsTable/PropDef.ts) type for reference):

```js
{
    name,
    required, // defaults to false
    description,
    type: { summary, detail },
    defaultValue: { summary, detail },
  }
```

### Example

```js
let flagDef = {
  type: { summary: 'boolean' },
  defaultValue: { summary: 'false' },
}

let props = {
  sections: {
    flags: [
      { name: 'compact', ...flagDef },
      { name: 'large', ...flagDef },
    ],
    other: [
      {
        name: 'onClick',
        description: 'click handler for button',
        type: { summary: 'function' }
      }
    ]
  },
}

export default {
  title: 'Button',
  parameters: { docs: { props } },
}
```
